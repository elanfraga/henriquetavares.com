My personal blog where I post some things I have learned and am learning in an attempt to try to contribute to the dev community in some way. I affectionately call it my public evernote.

Currently I have been studying and working with `JavaScript`, being more specific, working on` ReactJS`, `React Native` and` NodeJS` stacks, but I want to talk about everything I am learning and it is not just a technology.

### Thanks

Forked and inspired by [Dan Abramov's](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io)  project in turn forked from [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog). Syntax theme based on [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme/) with small tweaks.

To run locally, `yarn`, then `yarn dev`, then open https://localhost:8000.
